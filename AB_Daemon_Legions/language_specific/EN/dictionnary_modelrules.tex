\newcommand{\immortaldenizensdef}{%
Casting rolls made by models in a Daemon Legions army with one or two dice gain a +1 Casting Modifier. For casting rolls with a single Magic Dice, a natural roll of \result{1} or \result{2} is always a failed Casting Attempt, regardless of any modifiers. In addition, in a game involving at least one Daemon Legions Army, each player adds +2 Veil Tokens to their Veil Token pool in the Magic Phase during Siphon the Veil when they are the Active Player.%
}

\newcommand{\aegisdef}{%
Unit profiles in this Army Book contain an additional Characteristic, which corresponds to the units' Aegis Saves, shortened \Aeg{}. This Characteristic is treated as if the unit has the Personal Protection Aegis (X+) written on their profile, where X is the \Aeg{} Characteristic value. Not having an \Aeg{} value does not prevent a unit from being the target of an Aegis modifier.%
}

\newcommand{\greaterdominiondef}{%
At the start of each friendly Player Turn, you may choose one friendly unit within the Commanding Presence range of the model with Greater Dominion. All \rnf{} models in the chosen unit gain the Dominion rule in the Character's unit entry until the end of the next Player Turn.%
}

\newcommand{\darkfiredef}{%
Armour Save rolls of \result{1}, \result{2}, \result{3}, and \result{4} are \textbf{always} considered failed when saving wounds caused by \darkfire{}.%
}
