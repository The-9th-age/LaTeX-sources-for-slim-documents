% Army Model Rules Texts

\newcommand{\favoursofthedarkgodsintro}{A Character with a Favour cannot join a unit that contains any models with a different Favour than the Character.}

\newcommand{\envydef}{%
The model part gains \textbf{\devastatingcharge{} (+1 \AP{})}. Charge Range rolls by units with more than half of their models with this Favour are subject to Maximised Roll.
}

\newcommand{\gluttonydef}{%
The first time a model with this Favour successfully Charges a Fleeing unit, or is on the winning side of a combat and does not Pursue or Overrun, its model parts with this Favour gain +1 Strength on all their Close Combat Attacks (the effect lasts for the duration of the game).
}

\newcommand{\greeddef}{%
The bearer gains \gw{}, \halberd{}, \pw{}, and \textbf{\weaponmaster}. A Character with this Favour has its Special Item allowance increased by 50 pts.
\columnbreak % You may place this where you want the column break to balance the 2 columns. If you do not put it, it will be done automatically.
}

\newcommand{\lustdef}{%
The model gains \textbf{\feignedflight{}} and \textbf{\strider{}}. Units with more than half of their models with this Favour may declare Flee as a Charge Reaction even if they have Fearless. The Rally Test after voluntarily declaring Flee as a Charge Reaction is subject to Minimised Roll.
}

\newcommand{\pridedef}{%
Discipline Tests taken by units with at least one model with this Favour are subject to Minimised Roll.
}

\newcommand{\slothdef}{%
Models with this Favour gain +1 Resilience. If a model with this Favour declares a Charge against an enemy unit that is more than \distance{10} away or performs a March Move of more than \distance{10}, this effect is lost until the start of the Melee Phase in the next Player Turn.
}

\newcommand{\wrathdef}{%
The model part gains \textbf{\lightningreflexes} and +1 Agility. Close Combat Attacks allocated towards the model gain +1 to hit. These effects are only applied in the First Round of Combat.
}

\newcommand{\pathfavoureddef}{%
When the model issues or fights a Duel, it adds +1 to the Combat Score of its side until the end of the Round of Combat (note that this bonus is lost if the model with \pathfavoured{} is removed as a casualty).
}
\newcommand{\pathexileddef}{%
At the end of step 7 of a Round of Combat (after taking Break Tests), models with Path of the Exiled in a unit that failed a Break Test simultaneously perform Close Combat Attacks (ignoring the rules for Initiative Order, but otherwise following the normal rules such as Supporting Attacks and Allocating Attacks). Afterwards, they are removed as casualties. Models with Path of the Exiled cannot join or be joined by models with \pathfavoured{}. 
}
\newcommand{\favouredchampiondef}{%
The model gains +1 Agility, +1 Offensive Skill, +1 Defensive Skill, and +1 Health Point. Model parts with \harnessed{} are not affected.
}
\newcommand{\irredeemabledef}{%
The model cannot make Stomp Attacks and can make \grindattacks{} as Supporting Attacks, ignoring the maximum number of Supporting Attacks. When a model with \irredeemable{} is killed by a Melee Attack, remove it as a casualty only at the end of Initiative Step 0. A unit with at least one model with \irredeemable{} may never have more ranks than files. 
}
\newcommand{\veilwalkerdef}{%
When a model with \veilwalker{} casts any non-Bound Spell, you may discard one Veil Token when declaring the target(s) of the spell and activate one of the following effects:
\begin{itemize}
\item \spellformat{Secret of Flesh}{}: Failed to-wound rolls from this spell must be rerolled.
\item \spellformat{Secret of Separation}{}: The spell's range is increased by \distance{6}. Aura spells only gain +\distance{3} range. Spells with type: Caster are unaffected.
\item \spellformat{Secret of Substance}{}: Successful Armour Saves against wounds caused by this spell must be rerolled.
\end{itemize}
}
\newcommand{\battlefeverdef}{%
Units with more than half of their models with \battlefever{} must reroll any natural rolls of \result{1} when rolling for Charge Range. 
}
\newcommand{\unburntdef}{%
Flaming Attacks made against the model must reroll successful to-wound rolls.
}
\newcommand{\hellforgedarmordef}{%
Follows the rules for \pa{} (can be enchanted as if it was \pa{}). The wearer's model gains \textbf{\fearless{}} and \textbf{\aegis{} (5+, against Toxic Attacks)}.
}
\newcommand{\spikedshielddef}{%
Models on foot only. Follows the rules for Shields (can be enchanted as if it was a Shield). For each \textbf{successful} Armour Save roll of \textbf{4+} made by the bearer against a Melee Attack while using a Spiked Shield, the model that caused the wound suffers 1 hit with the bearer's \Strength{} and \ArmourPenetration{}. This is considered a Special Attack.
}
