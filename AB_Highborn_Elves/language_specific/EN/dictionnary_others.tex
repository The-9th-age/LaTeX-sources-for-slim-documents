\newcommand{\favourofmeladysdef}{%
Immediately after successfully casting the spell, add one Veil Token to your Veil Token pool.\newline%
When a friendly unit within \distance{18} of the Caster would lose a Health Point, you may discard a Veil Token from your Veil Token pool instead (this is done before taking Special Saves) and the Health Point loss is ignored. An attack with Multiple Wounds will inflict one wound less than usual instead. For Standard Infantry, up to 2 Health Point losses are ignored per token (provided they are suffered simultaneously). A maximum of two Veil Tokens may be discarded each phase for this purpose. Characters and Gigantic models can only ignore a single lost Health Point this way per phase.%
