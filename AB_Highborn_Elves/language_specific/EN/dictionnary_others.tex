Immediately after successfully casting the spell, add one Veil Token to your Veil Token pool.\newline%
When a friendly unit within \distance{18} of the Caster suffers a wound before Special Saves, you may discard a Veil Token from your Veil Token pool instead and the wound is ignored. An attack with Multiple Wounds will inflict one wound less than usual instead. For Standard Infantry, up to 2 wounds are ignored per token provided they are suffered simultaneously. A maximum of two Veil Tokens may be discarded each phase for this purpose. Characters and Gigantic models can only ignore a single wound this way per phase.%
