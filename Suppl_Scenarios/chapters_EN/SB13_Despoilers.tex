\subsection*{Deployment}

Deployment Zones are areas more than \distance{10} away from \rewordedrule{the Centre Line}. Only models that are Cavalry, have Light Troops and/or Scout may be deployed within \distance{12} of the short \rewordedrule{Board E}dges.

When declaring Special Deployment, players may choose to keep up to two of their units as reinforcement. These units follow the rules for Ambush\rewordedrule{ing units}, except \rewordedrule{that} they automatically arrive in Game Turn 1\rewordedrule{,} and must be placed touching the \rewordedrule{owner's} long \rewordedrule{Board E}dge.

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

\rewordedrule{During step 7 of the Deployment Phase Sequence (after moving Vanguarding units and before rolling for first turn),} both players take turns \rewordedrule{in} openly choosing three units with a Standard Bearer (excluding the Battle Standard Bearer)\rewordedrule{ from their opponent's Army List, starting with the player that finished deploying first. If there are less than three units with a Standard Bearer in an Army List, the opponent automatically chooses all units with a Standard Bearer instead. If there are none in the army, the opponent chooses a single Scoring Unit instead.} Units currently \rewordedrule{not} on the \rewordedrule{board} (such as Ambushing units) may still be chosen.

\subsection*{Winning the Secondary Objective}

At the end of the game, the player that has the highest number of \rewordedrule{their} chosen units still alive wins th\rewordedrule{is} Secondary Objective.
