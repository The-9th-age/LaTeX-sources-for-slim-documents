\flufffont{An Infernal Dwarves train loaded with valuable warpstone is headed for a safe passage. Two armies will both try to steal as much of the cargo as possible before the train makes its escape into the mountains.}

\subsection*{Deployment}

\rewordedrule{Standard Deployment Type:} Frontline Clash\rewordedrule{.}

\printmap{pics/deployment_11_runaway_train.pdf_tex}

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

Set up the \rewordedrule{Battlefield} with a line between \rewordedrule{the} short \rewordedrule{Board E}dge\rewordedrule{s} representing the track on which the \rewordedrule{T}rain will move. The line \rewordedrule{may} be curved\rewordedrule{, however, the curves must} be balanced \rewordedrule{with} how close \rewordedrule{they are} positioned to each player's \rewordedrule{D}eployment \rewordedrule{Z}one. Place an objective in the form of a \rewordedrule{T}rain \rewordedrule{with a base of} approximately \distance{6\timess{}2} on the tracks with its back against \rewordedrule{a randomly determined} short \rewordedrule{Board E}dge. For \rewordedrule{rules} purposes\rewordedrule{,} the train counts as Impassable Terrain.

\subsection*{Scenario Special Rules}

\subsubsection*{Fully Loaded Train}

At the beginning of each \rewordedrule{P}layer \rewordedrule{T}urn, roll 2D6: this is \rewordedrule{the distance in inches} the \rewordedrule{T}rain travels \rewordedrule{forwards} on the track.

If the \rewordedrule{T}rain comes into contact with a unit \rewordedrule{during its travel}, \rewordedrule{it immediately} stops \rewordedrule{(}in base contact\rewordedrule{, without aligning)} and the unit suffers 6D6 \rewordedrule{hits with} Strength 4 \rewordedrule{and Armour Penetration 1}. The unit is \rewordedrule{Shaken until the end of the Player Turn}.

\subsection*{Winning the Scenario}

At the \rewordedrule{start} of \rewordedrule{each Player Turn, starting with Game Turn 2}, the player with the closest \rewordedrule{S}coring \rewordedrule{U}nit \rewordedrule{to the Train, as long as it is at least} within \distance{6}\rewordedrule{,} gains 1 \rewordedrule{Victory Counter}. If \rewordedrule{there} is a tie, no \rewordedrule{Victory Counter} is awarded that \rewordedrule{Player T}urn. A maximum of 6 \rewordedrule{Victory Counters total} can be awarded this way.

\rewordedrule{At the end of the game, the player with the most Victory Counters wins the game.}
