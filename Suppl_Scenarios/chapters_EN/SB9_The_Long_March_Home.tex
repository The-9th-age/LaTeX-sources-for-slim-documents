\label{TheLongMarchHome}

\flufffont{The long war is just about over, and your army has just started the long march home\rewordedrule{, o}nly to find your path blocked by yet another foe. Push past them as quickly as you can, and if some were to fall, that just means a few less mouths to feed on the way home.}

\subsection*{Deployment}

\rewordedrule{Standard Deployment Type:} Marching Column\rewordedrule{s}\rewordedrule{.}

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

Once a player has deployed all of their units (excluding units that \rewordedrule{use Special Deployment} such as \rewordedrule{A}mbush or \rewordedrule{S}cout) \rewordedrule{and declared his intent to go first or second}, that player must place a marker \rewordedrule{with its centre} within their opponent's Deployment Zone. The other player then \rewordedrule{deploys their remaining units} and places a marker \rewordedrule{with its centre} within the\rewordedrule{ir} opponent's Deployment Zone. \rewordedrule{Continue with step 5 of the Deployment Phase Sequence (deployment of Scouting units) as usual}.

\subsection*{Scenario Special Rules}

When calculating Victory Points, Core Units are worth half of \rewordedrule{their normal Point Cost (also when Fleeing and/or Shattered)}.

\subsection*{Winning the Secondary Objective}

The player with the most Scoring Units within \distance{6} of the \rewordedrule{marker they placed} at the end of the game wins th\rewordedrule{is} Secondary Objective.
