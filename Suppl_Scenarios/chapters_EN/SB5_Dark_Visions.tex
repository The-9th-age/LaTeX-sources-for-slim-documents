\label{DarkVisions}

\flufffont{An evil presence haunts these lands. Its will at times manifest\rewordedrule{s itself} to you, \rewordedrule{compelling} you to lead \rewordedrule{its next victim} to \rewordedrule{feed its insatiable hunger}. Please the spirit and you may go safely.}

\subsection*{Deployment}

\rewordedrule{Standard Deployment Type:} Encircle\rewordedrule{.}

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

\rewordedrule{Place a small Impassable Terrain Feature (approximately \distance{3\timess{}3}) suitable to represent the source of The Gaze in the centre of the board, or, if there already is another Terrain Feature there, as close as possible to the centre of the board, but at least \distance{1} away from other Terrain Features. In case you don't have any suitable Impassable Terrain Feature available, you may mark the centre of the board as the source of The Gaze with a marker instead.}

If a result is not applicable, \rewordedrule{roll} the D6 \rewordedrule{again} until it is. The Gaze remains on a unit until the end of the game. \rewordedrule{If two or more potential targets of The Gaze are equally close to the centre of the source of The Gaze, randomise which of these units is targeted.}
