\flufffont{Both you and your foe have a clue of where the secrets of these lands are hidden. Play it carefully, and you might figure out your opponent's clue, but also make sure your own bluff isn't seen through.}

\subsection*{Deployment}

\rewordedrule{Standard Deployment Type:} Counterthrust\rewordedrule{.}

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

After determining Deployment Zones, both players \rewordedrule{alternately} place two markers \rewordedrule{each} on the Battlefield, starting with the player that \rewordedrule{chose their} Deployment Zone. Each marker has to be placed \rewordedrule{with its center on a point that is} within \distance{6} of the \rewordedrule{C}entre \rewordedrule{L}ine \rewordedrule{and} at least \distance{6} away from the \rewordedrule{Board Edge}. In the \rewordedrule{figure} below\rewordedrule{,} this area is marked in orange. \rewordedrule{In addition, each marker must be placed with its centre at least \distance{11} away from any other marker's centre and more than \distance{1} away from Impassable Terrain.}

\rewordedrule{Label t}he markers with numbers from 1 \rewordedrule{to} 4. \rewordedrule{During step 7 of the Deployment Phase Sequence}, each player secretly chooses one of the markers (write \rewordedrule{down its number} on a piece of paper). Players may choose freely between markers placed by themselves and by their opponent.

\subsection*{Special Scenario Rules}

At the end of Game Turn 5, both players reveal \rewordedrule{which} marker \rewordedrule{they chose}. 

\subsection*{Winning the Secondary Objective}

At the end of the game\rewordedrule{,} the player controlling most of the chosen markers wins th\rewordedrule{is} Secondary Objective. A marker is controlled by the player with the most Scoring Units within \distance{6} of the \rewordedrule{centre of the} marker. If a unit is within \distance{6} of \rewordedrule{the centre of both} marker\rewordedrule{s}, it only counts as within \distance{6} of the \rewordedrule{centre of the} marker which is closest to its \rewordedrule{C}entre (randomi\rewordedrule{s}e if both markers\rewordedrule{' centres} are equally close).
