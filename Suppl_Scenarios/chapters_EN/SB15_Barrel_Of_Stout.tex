\printmap{pics/deployment_3_1_barrel_of_stout.pdf_tex}

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

Place the Stout Marker at the centre of the \rewordedrule{board}.

\subsection*{Scenario Special Rules}

At the start of each of your Player Turns, except for the first, any of your Scoring Units may pick up the Stout Marker \rewordedrule{if they are in contact with its centre}. Remove the marker from the Battlefield: the unit is now carrying the marker.

\rewordedrule{Units carrying the marker with less than 3 Full Ranks cannot perform March Moves.}

If a unit that is carrying the Stout Marker is destroyed or Flees, the opponent must immediately place the marker \rewordedrule{with its centre on a point} within \distance{3} of the unit. This \rewordedrule{point} cannot be within \distance{1} of Impassable Terrain, but can be inside a unit.

The unit carrying the Stout Marker gains \textbf{Fearless}.

\subsection*{Winning the Secondary Objective}

At the end of the game, \rewordedrule{if a unit is carrying the Stout Marker, its owner wins the Secondary Objective.}
