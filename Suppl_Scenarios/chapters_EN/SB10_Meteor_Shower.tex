\label{MeteorShower}

\flufffont{The area has been showered with meteors containing valuable Darkstone. This material has strange properties, but it just might be used to your advantage as you collect the meteor remains.}

\subsection*{Deployment}

\rewordedrule{Standard Deployment Type:} Counterthrust\rewordedrule{.}

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

\rewordedrule{After step 8 of the Pre-Game Sequence (immediately} before \rewordedrule{the} Deployment \rewordedrule{Phase)}, place 5 meteor markers \rewordedrule{with their centres} evenly along the \rewordedrule{Centre Line (}each \distance{12} apart\rewordedrule{)}. Then move each marker D6\timess{}\distance{2} in a random direction. If a \result{6} is rolled, the marker is not moved at all. Finally, adjust the position of each marker by the minimal amount until it\rewordedrule{'s centre} is \distance{1} clear of all Impassable Terrain \rewordedrule{if necessary}.

\subsection*{Scenario Special Rules}

At the start of each of your Player Turns, except for the first, any of your units may pick up meteor markers \rewordedrule{whose centre they are in contact with}. Remove the marker from the Battlefield: the unit is now carrying the marker. \rewordedrule{Units carrying a marker with less than 3 Full Ranks cannot perform March Moves.}

If a unit that is carrying markers is destroyed or \rewordedrule{loses Scoring}, the opponent must immediately place all markers carried by this unit \rewordedrule{with their centres on points} within \distance{3} of it. These \rewordedrule{points} cannot be within \distance{1} of Impassable Terrain \rewordedrule{or the centres of other meteor markers}, but can be inside a unit.

Non-\rewordedrule{B}ound Spells cast by models in units carrying one or more meteor markers must reroll all Magic Dice that result in a \result{1}. If the \rewordedrule{Caster} would do \rewordedrule{so} normally, it also gains a +1 \rewordedrule{Casting M}odifier.

\subsection*{Winning the Secondary Objective}

At the end of the game\rewordedrule{,} the player whose Scoring Units carry the most meteor markers wins th\rewordedrule{is} Secondary Objective. \rewordedrule{Note that non-Scoring units may pick up markers but do not count towards winning this Secondary Objective.}
