\flufffont{With scheduled reinforcements inbound for both sides, claiming strategically sound positions in the local area becomes all the more important to make sure a decisive victory can be had at a later point.}

\subsection*{Deployment}

\rewordedrule{Standard Deployment Type:} Frontline Clash\rewordedrule{,} with the exception that unit\rewordedrule{s} may \rewordedrule{not} be \rewordedrule{deployed within} \distance{12} of \rewordedrule{the} short \rewordedrule{Board E}dge\rewordedrule{s}.

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

One \rewordedrule{player} is the Attacker and \rewordedrule{the other player} is the Defender. This is randomi\rewordedrule{s}ed at the beginning of \rewordedrule{step 6 of the Pre-Game Sequence (}before \rewordedrule{determining Deployment Zones)}. The Attacker gets the first turn.

\subsection*{Winning the Scenario}

The \rewordedrule{Attacker} receives \rewordedrule{bonus Battle} Points \rewordedrule{for having friendly units inside} the \rewordedrule{Defender}'s \rewordedrule{D}eployment \rewordedrule{Z}one \rewordedrule{at the end of the game}, while the \rewordedrule{Defender} receives points for preventing that. \rewordedrule{Determine the Battle Points as usual, add up the combined Point Costs of the Attacker's non-Fleeing units inside the Defender's Deployment Zone, and u}se the table \rewordedrule{below} to calculate the amount of bonus \rewordedrule{Battle} Points scored\rewordedrule{. Units at or below \SI{25}{\percent} of their starting Health Points (excluding Characters joined to the unit) count towards these bonus points with only half their Point Costs, rounding fractions up.}
