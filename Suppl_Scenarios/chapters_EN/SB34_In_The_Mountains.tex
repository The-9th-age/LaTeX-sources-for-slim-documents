\flufffont{Dwarves don't usually appreciate when foreigners march on their territory without authorization. I was merely passing by, bringing my troops as a reinforcement for a most important war. I knew I would have been lucky if the dwarves had let me go through the valley, but walking around their territory would have taken more time than I can afford. Now I just have make most of my troops reach the other side.}

\subsection*{Deployment}

\rewordedrule{In this scenario, one player takes on the role of the Attacker while the other player is the Defender.} Use a standard \distance{\rewordedrule{72}}\timess{}\distance{\rewordedrule{48}} board. \rewordedrule{Randomly choose one short Board Edge to be the Attacker's Edge. The opposite short Board Edge is the Defender's Edge}.

\rewordedrule{Place two Hills, one along each long Board Edge, as long as the Board Edges and with a width of \distance{10}}. \rewordedrule{The long edges of the Hills facing towards the centre of the board are called Hill Lines.} Put three 1\timess\distance{12} \rewordedrule{Impassable Terrains} on \rewordedrule{each Hill Line} (\rewordedrule{six} in total)\rewordedrule{, parallel to the Hill Lines, and with t}heir cent\rewordedrule{res on the Hill Lines} \rewordedrule{at} \distance{6}, \distance{36}\rewordedrule{,} and \distance{66} \rewordedrule{from} the \rewordedrule{A}ttacker's \rewordedrule{E}dge. Then \rewordedrule{move} each \rewordedrule{of them} \distance{2D6} \rewordedrule{along the Hill Lines, randomising in which direction} (if it can't \rewordedrule{be moved there}, don't move it \rewordedrule{at all}).

Finally\rewordedrule{,} add three Ruins \rewordedrule{on the Centre Line} at \distance{12}, \distance{36}\rewordedrule{,} and \distance{60} from the \rewordedrule{A}ttacker's \rewordedrule{E}dge\rewordedrule{,} and move them \distance{2D6} in a random direction.

The \rewordedrule{A}ttacker's \rewordedrule{D}eployment \rewordedrule{Z}one is a\rewordedrule{n area less than \distance{14} away from the Centre Line and less than \distance{20} away} from the Attacker's \rewordedrule{E}dge. The \rewordedrule{D}efender's \rewordedrule{D}eployment \rewordedrule{Z}one \rewordedrule{correspond to} both Hills, \rewordedrule{at least} \distance{24} \rewordedrule{away from} the \rewordedrule{A}ttacker's \rewordedrule{E}dge.

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

The \rewordedrule{Defender's} army must be Infernal Dwarves or Dwarven Holds. \rewordedrule{Its Army Points are} limited to 3500 pts, but \rewordedrule{the limit of Hail of the Gods is increased to max. \SI{45}{\percent}, Barrage to max. \SI{30}{\percent}, Clan's Thunder to max. \SI{50}{\percent}, and Engines of War to max. \SI{30}{\percent}}. The \rewordedrule{Attacker's} army can be \rewordedrule{from any Army Book} and up to 4500 pts, but units with Fly \rewordedrule{are limited to max. \SI{25}{\percent}}.

\rewordedrule{The Deployment Phase Sequence is slightly modified.} \rewordedrule{At first t}he \rewordedrule{D}efender deploys their \rewordedrule{units with} War Machine, plus one unit for every unit with Scout the \rewordedrule{A}ttacker ha\rewordedrule{s in their Army List (regardless if these units use Special Deployment or not)}. Then the \rewordedrule{A}ttacker deploys their \rewordedrule{entire} army\rewordedrule{, including} their \rewordedrule{units with} Scout\rewordedrule{, but not including units using other Special Deployment such as Ambush. The units must be deployed within} \distance{48} \rewordedrule{of} the \rewordedrule{A}ttacker's \rewordedrule{E}dge\rewordedrule{. F}inally\rewordedrule{,} the \rewordedrule{D}efender deploys the rest of their army and their Scouts as usual.

\subsection*{Winning the Scenario}

The game ends after 7 \rewordedrule{Game T}urns. Count the Victory \rewordedrule{P}oints as usual. On top of that, \rewordedrule{when} a\rewordedrule{n Attacker's} unit \rewordedrule{finishes a move within} \distance{10} \rewordedrule{of} the \rewordedrule{Defender's E}dge\rewordedrule{,} and \rewordedrule{is} not \rewordedrule{E}ngaged in \rewordedrule{C}ombat nor \rewordedrule{F}leeing, \rewordedrule{the Attacker} can remove th\rewordedrule{is} unit from the game. \rewordedrule{The Point Costs of all units removed this way} count towards the \rewordedrule{A}ttacker's total \rewordedrule{Victory Points}. Moreover, all \rewordedrule{of the Attacker's} units that are f\rewordedrule{a}rther than \distance{10} of \rewordedrule{the Defender's E}dge at the end of the game \rewordedrule{award} \rewordedrule{their full P}oint \rewordedrule{Costs} to the \rewordedrule{D}efender\rewordedrule{,} as if they \rewordedrule{had been removed as casualties}.
