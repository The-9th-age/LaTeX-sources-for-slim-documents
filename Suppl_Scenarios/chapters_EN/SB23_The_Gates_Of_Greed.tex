\label{TheGatesofGreed}

\flufffont{Deep in the Wasteland, a grim monument towers over the landscape. No one knows who built it, but its homage to Sugulag is obvious. The Collector watches over this battlefield, and those who pass through his gate will be granted a fraction of his power.}

\subsection*{Deployment}

\rewordedrule{Standard Deployment Type:} Frontline Clash\rewordedrule{.}

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

For best thematic effect, the two armies \rewordedrule{used in this scenario} should have a good reason to be in the Wasteland. \rewordedrule{Among the m}ost suitable are \rewordedrule{Warriors of the Dark Gods}, \rewordedrule{Daemon Legions}, \rewordedrule{Ogre Khans,} and \rewordedrule{Infernal Dwarves}. \rewordedrule{Among the l}east suitable are \rewordedrule{Saurian Ancients}, \rewordedrule{Sylvan Elves,} and \rewordedrule{Undying Dynasties}. 

Place an Icon of Greed \rewordedrule{Terrain Feature} in the centre of the \rewordedrule{board}. It should have a size of about 2\timess{}\distance{8} and allow units to be placed inside it (\rewordedrule{e.g.} be removable from its base).

\subsection*{Scenario Special Rules}

\subsubsection*{The Collector's Due}

\rewordedrule{Each c}haracter participating in this battle can take an additional 50 pts worth of Special \rewordedrule{Items}, Daemonic \rewordedrule{Manifestations,} or Runic Items.

Whenever a Character kills an enemy model in a Duel, it may immediately claim one \rewordedrule{piece of equipment carrying a} Special \rewordedrule{Item}, \rewordedrule{a} Daemonic \rewordedrule{Manifestation} or \rewordedrule{a} Runic Item carried by the slain model \rewordedrule{(including Artefacts)}. If \rewordedrule{so, and} the \rewordedrule{Character} already has \rewordedrule{a piece of equipment carrying} an item of the same \rewordedrule{category}, it \rewordedrule{must} discard \rewordedrule{a piece of equipment carrying} an item of \rewordedrule{that category of your} choice to make room for the new item\rewordedrule{. For example,} to claim an Enchanted Weapon (or equivalent Runic Item), the model \rewordedrule{must} first discard its Enchanted Weapon to claim \rewordedrule{the} new one.

\rewordedrule{Note that:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \rewordedrule{Any used One use only items and destroyed items cannot be claimed.}
\item \rewordedrule{Enchanted shields and enchanted Suits of Armour are considered different categories for this purpose.}
\item \rewordedrule{The maximum amount of points a Character can spend on Special or Runic Items is ignored when claiming a piece of equipment.}
\item \rewordedrule{The usual restrictions for weapons still apply (e.g. a model on foot cannot use a Lance).}
\item \rewordedrule{Only Wizards can claim Special Items that are restricted to Wizards, and Wizards cannot claim Special Items that are for non-Wizards only.}
\item \rewordedrule{Only Characters that could normally take a Banner Enchantment can claim an Enchanted Banner.}
\item \rewordedrule{Otherwise you can also claim equipment that the model normally does not have access to (e.g. a Character that has only access to Light Armour can claim an enchanted Heavy Armour).}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Icon of Greed}

The \rewordedrule{Terrain Feature} at the centre of the \rewordedrule{board} has the following rules.

\begin{tableterrain}%
\textbf{Cover}&
The Icon of Greed \rewordedrule{is Covering Terrain for units inside and/or behind it that} contribute\rewordedrule{s} to Soft Cover.\\
\textbf{Movement}&
\rewordedrule{Gigantic models cannot move into or through} the Icon of Greed.\\
\textbf{Broken Ranks}&
Units with more than half of their \rewordedrule{models with the centre of their base inside} the Icon of Greed can never be Steadfast\rewordedrule{, unless specifically stated otherwise}.\\
\textbf{Blessing of Sugulag}&
A \rewordedrule{non-Fleeing} unit that \rewordedrule{is in contact with} the centre of the Icon of Greed gains \textbf{Scoring} for the rest of the \rewordedrule{game, unless it was making a Flying Movement}. If the unit already has Scoring, it count\rewordedrule{s double for The Grass is Greener}. A unit cannot gain the Blessing of Sugulag more than once.\\
\end{tableterrain}

\subsection*{Winning the Scenario}

There are two objectives in the game. If both players win one \rewordedrule{each,} the game is a draw. If only one player wins one of the objective\rewordedrule{s}, that player \rewordedrule{achieves} a minor victory. If one player wins both \rewordedrule{objectives,} that player \rewordedrule{achieves} a ma\rewordedrule{jor} victory. \rewordedrule{The two objectives are:}

\begin{tableterrain}%
\textbf{Master Collector}&
At the end of the game, calculate how many points each player has in Special \rewordedrule{Items}, Daemonic \rewordedrule{Manifestations,} or Runic Item\rewordedrule{s} on models \rewordedrule{that haven't been removed as casualties} (including points from items stolen using The Collector's Due)\rewordedrule{, then} subtract \rewordedrule{the amount of} points \rewordedrule{originally spent on these items in their respective Army Lists}. \rewordedrule{The player with the higher total following this calculation is the winner of this objective}.\\
\textbf{The Grass is Greener}&
\rewordedrule{You must have more Scoring Units inside your} opponent's Deployment Zone \rewordedrule{than they have in yours} at the end of the game.\\
\end{tableterrain}
